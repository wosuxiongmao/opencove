# Contributing to OpenCove 🤝

First off, thank you for considering contributing to OpenCove! 🎉

OpenCove is an ambitious open-source project aimed at redefining how we interact with AI agents in a spatial workspace. Building a high-performance, complex desktop OS-like environment requires discipline. To ensure we can iterate rapidly without breaking the core experience, we maintain strict engineering and architectural standards.

> **🚨 CRITICAL FIRST STEP:**
> Before you write any code, you **MUST** read [DEVELOPMENT.md](./DEVELOPMENT.md). 
> It contains our architectural boundaries, state ownership rules, and execution workflows. **All PRs are expected to strictly adhere to the guidelines outlined there.**

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## 💻 Development Workflow

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: `>= 22`
- **pnpm**: `>= 9`
- **OS**: macOS, Windows, or Linux

### Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/DeadWaveWave/opencove.git
cd opencove

# 2. Install dependencies
pnpm install

# 3. Start the dev environment
pnpm dev
```

### Verification & CI

Before submitting a Pull Request, you must ensure your code meets our quality bar.

| Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `pnpm pre-commit` | **The ultimate gatekeeper.** Runs type checks, linting, formatting, and tests. |
| `pnpm test -- --run` | Runs the unit test suite natively. |
| `pnpm test:e2e` | Runs Playwright end-to-end tests (requires `pnpm build` first). |

## 📐 The Golden Rules of Engineering

To get your PR merged quickly, your contribution must reflect the values detailed in `DEVELOPMENT.md`:

1. **Zero Failing CI**: Your PR **MUST pass all CI checks** (`pnpm pre-commit` must be completely green). We do not merge code with failing tests, type errors, or lint warnings.
2. **Lock Behavior with Tests**: Every meaningful code change (especially bug fixes and new features) **MUST** include corresponding tests to lock down the behavior. Do not just fix the bug; write the test that proves the bug can never return.
3. **Respect State Ownership**: If your PR touches persistence, IPC boundary, or recovery state, explicitly document who the "owner" of that state is. Multiple writers to the same source of truth will be rejected.
4. **Clean Architecture**: Never mix IO/IPC concerns with UI rendering. Keep the `Main`, `Preload`, and `Renderer` boundaries mathematically clean.

## 📥 Pull Request Process

1. **Keep it Focused**: A PR should do one thing well. If you are fixing a bug and refactoring a module, split them into two separate PRs.
2. **Conventional Commits**: Use conventional prefixes for your PR titles (e.g., `feat: spatial task layout`, `fix: terminal resize panic`, `chore: update deps`).
3. **Prove Your Work**: 
   - If it's a UI change, **attach screenshots or a screen recording**.
   - If it's a runtime-risk change, explain the invariants you considered and the test layer you chose to prove them.
4. **Self-Review**: Review your own diff before submitting. Make sure no console logs, `any` types, or commented-out code slipped through.
