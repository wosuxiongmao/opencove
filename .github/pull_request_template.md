## 💡 Change Scope

- [ ] **Small Change**: Fast feedback, localized UI/logic, low-risk.

## 🏗️ Large Change Spec (Required if "Large Change" is checked)

<!-- Based on our guidelines in DEVELOPMENT.md, you MUST provide the following for any structural or high-risk change: -->

**1. Context & Business Logic**
<!-- What is the core behavior being introduced or modified? -->

**2. State Ownership & Invariants**
<!-- 
- Who owns the newly introduced or modified state (e.g., Main, Renderer, SQLite)?
- What are the 1-3 invariants that this change must preserve? (e.g., "The terminal PTY is always guaranteed to be destroyed when the React node unmounts") 
-->

**3. Verification Plan & Regression Layer**
<!-- How is this change locked down? Which testing layer proves the bug can never return? (Unit, Contract, Integration, E2E) -->

## ✅ Delivery & Compliance Checklist

- [ ] My code passes the ultimate gatekeeper: **`pnpm pre-commit` is completely green**.
- [ ] I have included new tests to lock down the behavior (or explicitly stated why it's untestable).
- [ ] I have strictly adhered to the `DEVELOPMENT.md` architectural boundaries.
- [ ] I have attached a screenshot or screen recording (if this touches the UI).
- [ ] I have updated the documentation accordingly (if adding a feature or changing a contract).
